                    <p className="details-txt">To the average observer sushi may simply look like a little ball of rice with a slice of raw fish on top, but there is so much more that goes into the art of sushi-making than meets the eye. In Japanese culture, sushi is considered a true art form, as its appearance is just as important as how it tastes. Sushi must have the right color, flavor, and texture. And as many have learned from documentaries such as Jiro Dreams of Sushi, it can take years, or even decades to master the craft of sushi making.</p>
                    <p className="details-txt">we have Ogimoto from Japan who is 72 years old who is one of the world's best sushi maker with more than 50 years of experience in the art of sushi making and a leading forfront sushi maker in the sushi making industry.</p>
